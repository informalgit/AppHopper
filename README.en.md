# AppHopper

**App-level `Alt+Tab` for Windows, styled after PowerToys Window Hopper.**

Two shortcuts, two distinct jobs — exactly like macOS:

| Shortcut | Switches between | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `Alt+Tab` | **applications** | one entry per app, MRU order; sibling windows of the focused app never appear, so `Alt+Tab` always lands on a *different* app |
| ``Alt+` `` | **windows of the focused app** | handled by [PowerToys Window Hopper](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/window-hopper) (or any per-app cycler) |

No more "walking through" five Explorer windows to reach the browser: `Alt+Tab` jumps straight to the next *app*, ``Alt+` `` cycles inside the current one.


## Build

1. **The easiest route: double-click `build.bat` in the repository** — it terminates any running instance and embeds `app.manifest` so the resulting exe requests administrator privileges on launch. If an elevated instance is already running, quit it from the tray first; the locked output file would break the build.
2. Or run the compiler manually:
    ```bat
    C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\csc.exe -nologo -target:winexe -platform:anycpu -optimize+ -win32manifest:app.manifest ^
      -r:System.dll -r:System.Core.dll -r:System.Drawing.dll -r:System.Windows.Forms.dll ^
      -out:AppHopper.exe AppHopper.cs
    ```
Works on Windows 10 and 11.
